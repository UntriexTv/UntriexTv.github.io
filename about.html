		<h1>About me</h1>
		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>
			I am student of CS and self learner. I love exploring new
			posibilities in this field and I want to share my experiences, 
			knowledge and my point of view on some technologies.
		</p>
		<h2>What is my knowledge?</h2>
		<p>
			I started studying CS in 2019, so most of my skills developed over this time, but I was interested in computers even before that.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have experience in Linux, Python3, servers, site development and little bit of networking.
		</p>
		<h2>What hardware am I using?</h2>
		<p>
			I want to create my own homelab, to have my own enviroment to test and develop aplications/servers.
		</p>
		<p>My current setup uses:</p>
		<table id="setup">
			<tr>
				<th>N.</th>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>CPU</th>
				<th>RAM</th>
				<th>Storage</th>
				<th>Usage</th>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			In the future I want to start setting up my own homelab rack which I could take with me to university and different hauses.
