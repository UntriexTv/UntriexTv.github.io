		<h1>New Blog</h1>
        <p>I decided to update my site and create new blog, where I can share my projects, knowledge and experiences.</p>
        <h2>why did I create a blog?</h2>
        <p>I work on lot of projects and I am trying lot of new things. I want to have place, where I can preserve and share these experiences and foundings.</p>
        <p>I really hope that some people find this blog interesting and they will support my enthusiasm in CS.</p>
        <h2>There is room to improve</h2>

        <p>So far this blog only loads my posts from json file and displays it in div. Also there aren't comments, likes or any kind of database. That's because I decided to host this site on GitHub pages. But it can change in the future. I think in this moment there would not be any comments or activity, so mantaining a server would not make any sense.</p>
        <p>But if you want me to upgrade the site, add comments, improve delivery system, .... write your suggestions on my email in <a href="/about.html">About me</a> It will encourage me to continue in this</p>
