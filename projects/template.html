		<h1>Untriex</h1>
		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Matej but i like to use "Untriex" as my nickname on the internet. I was born in 2003 and now i am studying IT in hischool in Slovakia.</p>
		<p>I was interested in computers since I was a kid and My first steps to IT were programing in Batch programming language and editing sites with inspect element.</p>
		<p>Fast forward to year 2019, when i started going into highschool. That was when i learned basics of Python3, which started my journey. After a while i mannaged to learned how to use Linux, bases of ShellScript, Virtualisation on server, bases of docker and much more.</p>
		<h2>My goals</h2>
		<p>My probably biggest goal is to study Computer Science in America and develop lot of projects (prefferably open source) on my way there.</p>
