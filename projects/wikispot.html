		<h1>WikiSpot</h1>
		<p>IT academy in slovakia started competition in partnership with Telekom. We started doing project for smart city theme and we named our creation WikiSpot.</p>
		<h2>What it is?</h2>
		<p>It is network of raspberry pi's or other servers in p2p connection. Every RPI has data about location it is in and user can acces data on all the servers in the network by connecting to one of the servers using Wi-Fi and our android app.</p>
		<h2>What did we use</h2>
		<p>We had four members and each of them took care of one system: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Server/client/linux</li>
			<li>Computer vision</li>
			<li>Mobile app</li>
			<li>Webpage</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Server</h2>
		<p>I developed the server. Because it was meant for RPI I also created a image for sd card that will automaticaly configure the server. The servers can comunicate with each other and keep track of which one is online.</p>
		<p>It is possible thanks to "heartbeat table" that is shared and merged with every ping between servers. It stores basic information about every server like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Last seen</li>
			<li>Offline/online</li>
			<li>Files available on server</li>
			<li>Location</li>
			<li>ip addres</li>
		</ul>
