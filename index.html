			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hi! My name is Matej but i use "Untriex" as my nickname on the internet. I was born in 2003 and now i am studying IT in hischool in Slovakia.</p>

			<p>Fast forward to year 2019, when i started going into highschool. That was when i learned basics of Python3, which started my journey. After a while i mannaged to learned how to use Linux, bases of ShellScript, Virtualisation on server, bases of docker and much more.</p>
			<h2>My goals</h2>
			<p>My goal is to study at a university in America and by then create a lot of interesting open source projects for others and improve my knowlege.</p>
			<h2>Notice</h2>
			<p>This website/portfolio is still in development. Scheduled to complete by the end of the summer.</p>
